# My Dotfiles
My configuration files. I use zshell with oh-my-zsh, vim and tmux. The goal is for these files to work on both OS X and Ubuntu. These are mainly kept here to be accessible to myself, but you are welcome to use and try them if you like.

## Prerequisites
zsh, oh-my-zsh, vim, tmux and git needed. 

## Installing
_NOTE:_ Backup any dotfiles you already have before installing. The symlinking will remove any files you might already have with the same names.
1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it.
2. Run install.sh, you might have to enter your password.

To update, pull the repo and run install.sh again.

## To-do
* Check for and install prerequisites.
